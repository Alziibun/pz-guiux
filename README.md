# PZ GUI UX (Name Pending, of course) 
A mod to create a more comfortable player experience through recreating the PZ interface.
## Layout
### Hotbar
1. The Hotbar is highly modular with clothes like belts and backpacks adding to them
2. Some mods end up adding tons of slots like AuthenticZ
3. The Hotbar is overall fine on its own but it would be unfortunate to leave it as-is
4. The Handsbar needs to be displayed more centrally, preferably near the Hotbar

### Health, Skills, etc
1. Natively display the health bar for the player
2. Have a way of signaling injuries
3. A more fluid skill menu and exp display
### Inventory
Different view modes for the inventory
### Foraging
### Crafting
### Furnitures
